# Qwilt Provider Install Verification

This is a minimal, verification-only example intended solely to confirm that the Qwilt Terraform Provider is installed correctly.

To use this example:

1. Make sure your QCDN_API_KEY env variable is set. (This is the recommended authentication method.)

    For more information on authentication, see the provider documentation, which also covers alternative methods.

2. Apply the configuration:

    ```
    $ terraform apply
    ```
