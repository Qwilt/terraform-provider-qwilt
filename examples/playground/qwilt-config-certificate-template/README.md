# Qwilt Basic Resource Example

This is a simple example demonstrating how to configure a certificate template resource.


To use this example:

1. Make sure your QCDN_API_KEY env variable is set. (This is the recommended authentication method.)
   
    For more information on authentication, see the [User Guide](https://docs.qwilt.com/docs/terraform-user-guide#authentication), which also covers alternative methods.
   
2. Replace the placeholder values with your own specific configuration details. 

    Replace the example certificate and key values with your own.

3. Apply the configuration:

    ```
    $ terraform apply
    ```
