## Example Usage

```terraform
# The "required_providers" block declares the provider:

terraform {
  required_providers {
    qwilt = {
      source = "Qwilt/qwilt"
    }
  }
}


# The "provider" config (read about Authentication, above.):

provider "qwilt" {
}


# A named site resource:

resource "qwilt_cdn_site" "example" {
  site_name = "Terraform Basic Example Site"
}

# A named site configuration resource:

resource "qwilt_cdn_site_configuration" "example" {
  site_id = qwilt_cdn_site.example.site_id
  #host_index = file("./examplesitebasic.json")
  host_index         = <<-EOT

  certificate       = filebase64("./tf.example.com.crt")
  certificate_chain = filebase64("./tf.example.com.crt")
  private_key       = filebase64("./tf.example.com.key")
  description       = "Certificate for the Terraform basic example configuration"
}


# A named site activation resource:

resource "qwilt_cdn_site_activation" "example" {
  site_id        = qwilt_cdn_site_configuration.example.site_id
  revision_id    = qwilt_cdn_site_configuration.example.revision_id
