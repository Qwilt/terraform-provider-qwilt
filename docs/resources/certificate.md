## Schema

### Required

- `certificate_chain` (String) An ordered concatenation of PEM-encoded signed certificates. The first is the signer of the imported certificate, and the last is an intermediate CA signed by a well known Root CA. The whole string must be Base64 encoded.

### Optional

- `certificate` (String) A single X.509 signed PEM certificate, encoded in Base64.
- `description` (String) The certificate description.
- `private_key` (String) A PEM private key, which pairs with the public key that is embedded in the certificate. The entire string must be Base64 encoded.

### Read-Only

- `cert_id` (Number) The unique identifier of the certificate. The certId will be needed when you add the certificate configuration and when you assign it to a site.
- `domain` (String) The site host domain the certificate is linked to.
- `id` (Number) The unique identifier of the site. Equals cert_id. Required for testing infra
- `pk_hash` (String) A unique identifier for the private key that does not expose the actual key itself.
- `status` (String) The status of the certificate:["ISSUED",
          "ACTIVE",
          "EXPIRED",
          "REVOKED"].
- `tenant` (String) The organization your user is assigned to.
- `type` (String) The certificate type.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
#keep an empty resource to import into (Test Esther Delete This)
#after import is completed the user should manually set the required attributes in the resource from the imported state file
resource "qwiltcdn_certificate" "example" {

  #after import, the private_key will remain empty in the state.
  #to avoid plan keep detecting this as a change, add this lifecycle section to the imported resource
  lifecycle {
      ignore_changes = [
        private_key
      ]
    }
}

terraform import qwiltcdn_certificate.example <cert_id>
```
