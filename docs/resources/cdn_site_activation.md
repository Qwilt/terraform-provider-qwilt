# qwilt_cdn_site_activation (Resource)

Manages a Qwilt CDN site activation and certificate assignment.<br><br> - This resource takes a long time to fully apply.<br><br> - Any attempt to apply site_activation with the same site_id might encounter a failure due to another publish operation in-progress.<br><br> - Run ```terraform refresh``` to sync the state of this resource explicitly.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "qwilt_cdn_site_activation" "example" {
  site_id     = qwilt_cdn_site_configuration.example.site_id
  revision_id = qwilt_cdn_site_configuration.example.revision_id
  #certificate_id = qwilt_cdn_certificate.example.cert_id
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `revision_id` (String) Unique identifier of the configuration version that was published or unpublished.
- `site_id` (String) SiteId of the site the user wishes to publish or unpublish.

### Optional

- `certificate_id` (Number) The ID of the certificate you want to link to this site.

### Read-Only

- `creation_time_milli` (Number) The time when the publish operation was created, in epoch time.
- `id` (String) For internal use only, for testing. Equals site_id:publish_id.
- `is_active` (Boolean) Indicates if the configuration is active or inactive.
- `last_update_time_milli` (Number) When the publishing operation was last updated, in epoch time.
- `operation_type` (String) The operation type (Publish, Unpublish) that was initiated with the request. An Unpublish operation removes a delivery service from the CDN.
- `owner_org_id` (String) The organization that owns the site.
- `publish_acceptance_status` (String) The CDN validates and then accepts the publishing operation before initiating it. This attribute lets you track the acceptance process. It is not an indication of the status of the publishing operation on the CDN caches themselves.

  - Pending - Pending validation.
  - Invalid - Validation failed. 
  - Dismissed - Passed validation but failed to initiate.
  - Aborted - The publishing operation was cancelled.
  - In progress - The publishing operation is validated and pending initiation.
  - Accepted - The publishing operation was initiated.
- `publish_id` (String) The ID of the publishing operation for which you want to retrieve metadata.
- `publish_state` (String) For internal use. Use the 'publishStatus' values instead.
- `publish_status` (String) The publishing operation status. The 'publishStatus' values aggregate the 'publishState' values into broader categories. 

  - Success - The operation succeeded.
  - Failed - The operation failed.
  - Aborted - The operation was canceled.
  - InProgress - The operation is in progress.
- `target` (String) The value will always be 'ga'.
- `username` (String) Username that initiated the publishing operation.
- `validators_err_details` (String) Details about errors generated during validation.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
#Create an empty resource to import into.

#After the import is complete, manually set the required attributes 
#in the resource based on the imported state.

#We recommend changing the site_id and revision_id attributes to references
#to the qwilt_cdn_site_configuration resource to achieve implicit dependency.


resource "qwilt_cdn_site_activation" "example" {
}

    # Import the qwilt_cdn_site_activation resource by specifying the site_id. 

    # For example: terraform import qwilt_cdn_site_activation.example <site_id>

        # The process determines which configuration to import based on
        # the following conditions: 
        # - If there is an active published site configuration, it is imported.
        # - If not, the most recently saved configuration version is imported.
        
    # Alternatively, you can specify a particular publish_id by adding 
    # a colon (:) and the publish_id. 
    
    # For example: 
    #    */terraform import qwilt_cdn_site_activation.example xxxxxxxxxxxx:yyyyyyyyyyyy

terraform import qwilt_cdn_site_activation.example <site_id>:<publish_id>
```
