# qwilt_cdn_site_activation_staging (Resource)

⚠️ This is a limited availability feature. <br><br>Manages a Qwilt CDN site activation and certificate assignment in a staging environment. <br><br>This resource is similar to the *qwilt_cdn_site_activation* resource but activates the selected configuration to the staging environment only.<br><br>[Learn about the Publish to Staging Feature.](https://docs.qwilt.com/docs/publish-to-staging)

## Example Usage

```terraform
#Activation cannot be initiated while a previous activation is still 
#in progress.


resource "qwilt_cdn_site_activation_staging" "example" {
  site_id     = qwilt_cdn_site_configuration.example.site_id
  revision_id = qwilt_cdn_site_configuration.example.revision_id
  #certificate_id = qwilt_cdn_certificate.example.cert_id
}
```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `revision_id` (String) Unique identifier of the configuration version that was published or unpublished.
- `site_id` (String) SiteId of the site the user wishes to publish or unpublish.

### Optional

- `certificate_id` (Number) The ID of the certificate you want to link to this site. Cannot co-exist with certificate_template_id.
- `certificate_template_id` (Number) The ID of the certificate template you want to link to this site. Cannot co-exist with certificate_id.

### Read-Only

- `creation_time_milli` (Number) The time when the publish operation was created, in epoch time.
- `id` (String) For internal use only, for testing. Equals site_id:publish_id.
- `is_active` (Boolean) Indicates if the configuration is active or inactive.
- `last_update_time_milli` (Number) When the publishing operation was last updated, in epoch time.
- `operation_type` (String) The operation type (Publish, Unpublish) that was initiated with the request. An Unpublish operation removes a delivery service from the CDN.
- `owner_org_id` (String) The organization that owns the site.
- `publish_acceptance_status` (String) The CDN validates and then accepts the publishing operation before initiating it. This attribute lets you track the acceptance process. It is not an indication of the status of the publishing operation on the CDN caches themselves.

  - Pending - Pending validation.
  - Invalid - Validation failed. 
  - Dismissed - Passed validation but failed to initiate.
  - Aborted - The publishing operation was cancelled.
  - In progress - The publishing operation is validated and pending initiation.
  - Accepted - The publishing operation was initiated.
- `publish_id` (String) The ID of the publishing operation for which you want to retrieve metadata.
- `publish_state` (String) For internal use. Use the 'publishStatus' values instead.
- `publish_status` (String) The publishing operation status. The 'publishStatus' values aggregate the 'publishState' values into broader categories. 

  - Success - The operation succeeded.
  - Failed - The operation failed.
  - Aborted - The operation was canceled.
  - InProgress - The operation is in progress.
- `target` (String) The value will always be 'staging'.
- `username` (String) Username that initiated the publishing operation.
- `validators_err_details` (String) Details about errors generated during validation.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
> ⚠️ This is a limited availability feature.


#Create an empty resource to import into.

#After the import is complete, manually set the required attributes 
#in the resource based on the imported state.

#We recommend changing the site_id and revision_id attributes with references 
#to the qwilt_cdn_site_configuration resource to achieve implicit dependency.


resource "qwilt_cdn_site_activation_staging" "example" {
}

  # You can import the qwilt_cdn_site_activation_staging resource by specifying 
  # the site ID.

  # For example: 
  #  terraform import qwilt_cdn_site_activation_staging.example <site_id>

     # Which configuration is imported is based on these conditions: 
     # - If there is an active published site configuration, it is imported.
     # - If not, the most recently saved configuration version is imported.
    
  # Alternatively, you can specify a particular publish_id by adding a colon (:) 
  # and the publish_id. 

  # For example: 
  #     */terraform import qwilt_cdn_site_activation_staging.example xxxxxxxx:yyyyyyy

terraform import qwilt_cdn_site_activation_staging.example <site_id>:<publish_id>
```
